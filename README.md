##Data Source
We get our data from api of [http://stats.nba.com/](http://stats.nba.com/)  
Click [this](http://www.gregreda.com/2015/02/15/web-scraping-finding-the-api/) learn how to use it.
## Proposal and Process Book  
See our [proposal](https://github.com/jiangshijie/NBA_FINAL/blob/master/DataVisFianlProposal.pdf) describing prototype of our project , and
[process book](https://github.com/jiangshijie/NBA_FINAL/blob/master/ProcessBook.pdf) with detailed
explanations of the designing evolution for each visualization.  

##Questions We Try to Answer
For a single team, we tried to show the following facts:

- The location of selected team (map), its wining rate in the past season (size of spot)
- The overall performance of the team (radar).
- Games of this team and how many scores did they win or lose (calendar with color)
- For a selected game, all players in the game and their performance (bubble chart)

For the game history of two teams, we tried to show the following facts:  

- The overall performance comparison of these two teams. (radar)
- When did they had a game with each, how many scores did they get. (scatter and line)
- For a selected game between them, the metrics comparison one by one (bar chart), players' performance (bubble chart), hit rates (wave chart), and score composition (pie chart).
